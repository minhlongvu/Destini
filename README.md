# Destini ðŸ¤”

A choose your own adventure game app I coded using Flutter and based off starter code from [Angela Yu's (in collaboration with the Google Flutter team) Flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

See if you can explore all the story paths!

## Our Goal

In this challenge, you will be building a choose your own adventure game like Bandersnatch. In the process, you should apply your knowledge from the last module (Quizzler) to use Dart OOP principles to build a well organised project.
